📖 Overview:
PromptAlchemy is a lightweight, serverless tool designed to help developers and AI enthusiasts refine their interaction with Large Language Models. By leveraging the advanced reasoning of the Google Gemini API, the app analyzes vague input and reconstructs it with a professional persona, context, specific tasks, and constraints.
The project features a "Dark Mode/Neon" aesthetic with a Glassmorphism UI, tailored for focus and clarity. It is built as a Single-File Application, meaning the entire logic resides in one HTML file for maximum portability.

✨ Key Features:

🧪 AI-Powered Enhancement: Uses gemini-1.5-flash to rewrite drafts into structured, high-quality prompts.

🔐 Bring Your Own Key (BYOK): Security-first architecture. Your API key is stored only in your browser's sessionStorage and is cleared when the tab is closed.

📊 Live Analytics: Real-time character and word count tracking for both draft and output to monitor token usage.

⚡ Zero Latency UI: Optimized Vanilla JS ensures instant feedback and modal interactions without page reloads.

📱 Responsive Design: A stacked layout for mobile devices and a dual-column dashboard for desktops.

📋 One-Click Actions: Features dedicated buttons to copy the enhanced result or reset the API credentials instantly.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Core: HTML5, JavaScript (ES6+)

Styling: Tailwind CSS (via CDN), Custom CSS (Glassmorphism)

AI Integration: Google Gemini API (REST)

Icons: FontAwesome

Architecture: Client-Side / Single Page Application (SPA)

🚀 Getting Started
Since PromptAlchemy is a single-file application, running it is incredibly simple.

Prerequisites
A modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).

An active internet connection (to load Tailwind CDN and reach Google API).

Installation
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/WillByers/PromptAlchemy.git
cd PromptAlchemy
Run the app: Simply double-click index.html to open it in your browser.

Alternatively, you can use a live server:

Bash

npx serve .
🎮 Usage
Enter API Key: Upon loading, a modal will ask for your Google Gemini API Key.

Note: Get your free key at Google AI Studio.

Draft Your Idea: Type your basic request into the "Draft Input" box (e.g., "Write code for a snake game").

Transmute: Click the "Enhance Prompt" button.

Review & Copy: The AI will generate a detailed version in the right-hand column. Click "Copy Output" to use it.

Reset: If you need to change your API key, click the "Reset Key" button in the header.

🛡️ Privacy Note
PromptAlchemy is designed with absolute privacy in mind. The application runs entirely on the client side. Your personal API keys and prompt data are never sent to any intermediate server; they are transmitted directly to Google's Gemini API for processing and are not retained by the app owner.

Note: You need a valid Google Gemini API Key to use the enhancement features.
